🌟 Adhil Yoosaf Github Protfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. My computer science path is reflected in this repository, which highlights my interests, skills, and projects as I build my future in the technology industry.  
  
- 👋 Hi, I’m Adhil Yoosaf, a passionate BSc Computer Science student at University of South Walees. Originally from India, I recently moved to the UK in September 2025 to pursue my dream of studying technology in an international setting.  

What excites me most about Computer Science is its potential to shape the future. From Artificial Intelligence to cybersecurity, I believe technology is the driving force behind innovation and transformation. My curiosity and determination fuel my drive to solve complex problems and make meaningful contributions to the field.  
 
I am currently in my first year of **BSc Computer Science**, diving into core areas of technology. My current modules include:  
- **Professionalism, Employability, and Enterprise**  
- **Programming**  
- **Information Management, Assurance, and Security**  

These modules are helping me develop technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and professional attributes essential for the tech industry. I’m also working on multiple projects that challenge me to apply what I’m learning in real-world scenarios.  

- **Programming Languages**: C++, Python (basic knowledge), problem-solving techniques  
- **Tools and Platforms**: Visual Studio, GitHub, basic knowledge of databases  
- **Soft Skills**: Teamwork, adaptability, communication, and attention to detail  
- **Special Interests**: Cryptography, AI, and cybersecurity fundamentals  
  
Here are some of the exciting projects I’ve worked on recently:  
1. **Decryption Techniques**  
   - Explored and implemented decryption methods like the Vigenère cipher and Caesar cipher to unlock encoded messages.  
2. **Programming Challenges**  
   - Solved multiple programming problems as part of my coursework, focusing on algorithms and debugging.  
3. **Group Project on Technology in Education**  
   - Collaborated with peers to create a presentation and written report on how technology enhances modern education.  

I am currently working on assignments and projects for my programming and information management modules, which are sharpening my coding and problem-solving skills.  

When I’m not coding or studying, I enjoy:  
- **Reading**: Exploring books and articles on tech trends and innovations  
- **Traveling**: Discovering new cultures and landscapes  
- **Music**: Listening to and exploring various genres for inspiration  
- **Sports**: Staying active with football and cricket
